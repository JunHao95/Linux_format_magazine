## Exchange Messages between task
install RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ pros: 
It is a messageBroker, can safely hold messages generated by application and make them available to other apps.
Reliable, support for clustering and high-availability queues, tracing capabilities for toubleshooting tricky issues, support for protocols other than AMQP and availability of tools and client libraries in many programming langugages.
No limit on payload size which is useful for exchanging large messages

It is written in Erland, might discourage ppl to extend it, and also does not support message batching
